README file for Groop App

Welcome to Groop App!

Groop is a social media app concept designed for students to connect with each other based on their academic and social interests. At present, the project only contains a sketch file in the repository, and there is no functioning app available for download. However, I am working hard to bring this concept to life, and I encourage you to stay tuned for updates.

Getting Started:
As there is no functioning app available at present, there is no account creation process or set of features to describe. However, I envision that the app will provide a platform for students to build meaningful connections and form communities around shared interests.

Future Updates:
I am committed to developing and launching the Groop app, and I will provide updates as the project progresses. I appreciate your interest in the concept and look forward to sharing more with you in the future.


Update:

I am pleased to announce that a demo of the Groop App is now available in the repository. You can find it in the form of an HTML file named "groop_demo.html". The demo provides a sneak peek into what the app would look like and how it would function.

To run the demo, simply open the HTML file in your preferred web browser. Please note that the demo is a prototype and does not contain all the features that will be available in the final version of the app.

I am still working hard to bring the full version of the Groop app to life and I appreciate your continued interest in the project. Stay tuned for further updates!
