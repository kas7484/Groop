README file for Groop App

Welcome to Groop App!

Groop is a social media app concept designed for students to connect with each other based on their academic and social interests. At present, the project only contains a sketch file in the repository, and there is no functioning app available for download. However, I am working hard to bring this concept to life, and I encourage you to stay tuned for updates.

Getting Started:
As there is no functioning app available at present, there is no account creation process or set of features to describe. However, I envision that the app will provide a platform for students to build meaningful connections and form communities around shared interests.

Future Updates:
I am committed to developing and launching the Groop app, and I will provide updates as the project progresses. I appreciate your interest in the concept and look forward to sharing more with you in the future.
